---

so black people don't enjoy fantasy football? i guess it's just the white guys that like to **still pretend to own a** team full of black guys. sorry

**should i play him over** james white this week?

---

i'**m debating selling robinson and** dorset for crabtree and snead. wish i had a fucking crystal ball to see how the rest of the season was going to go.

---

**i traded for him in** mid - october thinking he'd rebound, but was able to flip him a few days later for latavius murray. bullet dodged

---

i play him every **week. i know he**'s a brown but he's the 11th ranked wr in ppr.

---

**play adams over arob**

---

cmike totally going to knile davis his way back to the hawks just you wait, the fools who doubt the hype will have regret for dropping. don't though in all seriousness this is for **add / drop thread with** more details, no one has any idea of knowing what your situation is or who the fuck your choices are.

---

**nah percy harvin about to** take over.

---

i'm trying to decide if i should have tate in instead of jordy nelson. **i have stafford and my** other receivers are obj and brandon marshall ppr

---

don't annoint wentz as the second coming yet ; don't get **too cute. winston here**.

---

that's what i'm in. **about to start watkins over** nuk.

---

**http : / / imgur**. com / a / r2tvp

---

as a non owner of mccoy. dropped gillisle for **dujuan? not starting either**.

---

now i have to **decide between michael thomas and** maclin

---

hey man, floyd, **cobb, or sharpe as** my wr2. standard scoring.

---

*** * wtf did i** just read * *

---

yes. and **there is a thread for** this

---

dez bryant, **could i get amari cooper** for him?

---

advice on a trade proposed : i get : le'veon bell, randall cobb i give : antonio brown league :. 25 ppr roster : roethlisberger, cooks, d. murray, bernard, olsen, snead, t. williams, deangelo williams, j. white, devante adams, b. lafell, e. ebron, **w. smallwood. need** the depth at rb with deangelo riding the pine, but tough to part with brown.

---

sooooo langford against houston and **jj watt or cmike?**????

---

nice flair for that **" breaking news " mods**.

---

trying to **trade for him right now** ( 10 - team,. 5ppr, 2 rb, 2 wr, 2 flex ). his proposal was cooks ( wr2 ) / abdullah ( rb3 ) for cj. i am really high on cooks, though, thinking he can finish in top 10 wr.

---

i really like johnson ( i mean who doesn't, but still ) and have alot of depth at wr. i have julio and brandin cook, so i don't need larry fitz, who doesn't appear to be slowing down. the guy who has johnson just lost keenan allen. **ware and fitz for johnson**?
